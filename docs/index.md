## Introduction

_Tacent View_ is both fast and correct. Most of the image loading code is either custom or
based on official reference implementations. Once decoded, images are marshalled to GPU memory for
fast switching/rendering. The thumbnail viewer caches images/meta-data and can handle
thousands of files in a single directory at interactive speeds.

## Download

_Tacent View_ is distributed as:
1. Source Code
2. Portable Windows Zip
3. Linux Deb File
4. Snapcraft Snap

The source code, portable Windows zip, and deb files are available from the [releases GitHub page](https://github.com/bluescan/tacentview/releases). If running Linux you may also consider [installing the snap](https://snapcraft.io/tacentview). If you want to build it yourself, instructions are available at the [Tacent View GitHub page](https://github.com/bluescan/tacentview). The CMake build-system is used and can create projects (VS2022, make, nmake, ninja) for your desired compiler (MSVC, Clang, GCC). Build yourself if you have any security concerns. The buttons below link to pre-compiled versions of the latest stable release.

## Operation

There are two main modes in which _Tacent View_ may be used: **GUI** and **CLI**.

**GUI** mode is what you would expect -- Open an image file with tacentview.exe and a window will open displaying the image. If you install the _snap_ or _deb_ file, it will register with the OS to be able to open supported image formats (but will not change your defaults). On Windows you may optionally associate _Tacent View_ to a particular image type by selecting _Open with_ and then _Choose another app_.

**CLI** mode (Command-Line Interface) allows you to perform all operations that can be done in the **GUI** from the command-line. The same executable file is used for command-line operations, whether compiled for Linux or Windows. **CLI** mode is intended to allow batch processing and conversions of images from one format to another. It allows _Tacent View_ to be used in game pipelines and image processing workflows.

## Texture Pixel Formats

Some image formats are often used to store texture data that is easily decompressable by a GPU -- DDS, PVR, KTX, KTX2, ASTC, and PKM files are examples. Tacent View supports the following texture formats for these types of files:

| **Packed**      |                 |                 |                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| R8              | R8G8            | R8G8B8          | R8G8B8A8        |
| B8G8R8          | B8G8R8A8        | G3B5R5G3*       | G4B4A4R4*       |
| B4A4R4G4        | G3B5A1R5G2*     | G2B5A1R5G3*     | A8L8            |
| A8              | L8              |                 |                 |
| R16             | R16G16          | R16G16B16       | R16G16B16A16    |

| R32f            | R32G32f         | R32G32B32f      | R32G32B32A32f   |
| R11G11B10uf     | B10G11R11uf     | R9G9B9E5uf      | E5B9G9R9uf      |
| R8G8B8M8        | R8G8B8D8        |                 |                 |
|                 |                 |                 |                 |
| **Block (BC)**  |                 |                 |                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|

|                 |                 |                 |                 |
| **Block (ETC)** |                 |                 |                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| ETC1            | ETC2RGB         | ETC2RGBA        | ETC2RGBA1       |
| EACR11U         | EACR11S         | EACRG11U        | EACRG11S        |
|                 |                 |                 |                 |
| **PVR**         |                 |                 |                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| PVRBPP4         | PVRBPP2         |                 |                 |
|                 |                 |                 |                 |
| **ASTC**        |                 |                 |                 |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| ASTC4X4         | ASTC5X4         | ASTC5X5         | ASTC6X5         |
| ASTC6X6         | ASTC8X5         | ASTC8X6         | ASTC8X8         |
| ASTC10X5        | ASTC10X6        | ASTC10X8        | ASTC10X10       |
| ASTC12X10       | ASTC12X12       |                 |                 |

\* These formats are named like every other format in the table -- based on how the bits appear on disk and in memory. Some APIs call these B5G6R5 (BGR565), B4G4R4A4 (BGRA4444), and B5G5R5A1 (BGRA5551) but this is inconsistent with their other format names like B8G8R8 which are correct. Even taking little-endianness into account the adjusted names would be G3R5B5G3, R4A4B4G4, and G2R5A1B5G3 which does not match the in-memory representation. On the bright side, the LE-adjusted names for the PVR spec do make sense: G3B5R5G3 -> RGB565, G4B4A4R4 -> ARGB4444, and G3B5A1R5G2 -> ARGB1555.
