If PVRFMT == TACFMT the filename will be just FMT_TYPE_COLPRF_CHANS_FLAGS.pvr
The COLPRF is the colour profile which gives a bit more information than just the colour space.

Flags:
T = Regular 2D texture.
V = Volume 3D texture.
C = Cubemap. Has up to 6 2D textures.

A = Texture array. Has an arbitrary number of textures.
M = Has Mipmaps.
P = Premultiplied Alpha

Note that for PVRFMT we go with what is shown in PVRTexTool, not what the spec shows as it can be incorrect. For example, R8 G8 B8 A8 in the UI is encoded as pixel format 0x12 which is, according to Imagination's own PVR12 spec, ARGB 8888. In fact it IS R8G8B8A8 just like the UI shows.
The channel TYPE is the Tacent name for the type, not the PVRTexTool. For example:
FLOAT -> SFLOAT
