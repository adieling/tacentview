Raw pixel data file names follow the convention:
PixelFormat_WidthxHeight_ColourSpace_Offset_RowOrder_SurfOrMipCount

ColourSpace may be sRGB or lRGB.
Offset is ONN where NN is the offset count in bytes.
RowOrder is NR for no row-reversal and RR for row reversal.
SurfOfMipCount is SNN for surfaces and MNN for mipmaps. NN is count.
