The png images are the lossless individual images of the test cubemap. They are specififed in a left-handed coordinate system with +Z facing front and +Y up.

The cubemap images in the DDS, KTX2, and PVR files were all generated using PVRTexTool. An "_M" in the name means the cubemaps have mipmaps.
